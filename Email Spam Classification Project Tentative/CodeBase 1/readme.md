### First run the code extracting_unique_words_from_all_emails.py 
This helps to make file wordslist.csv which contains the unique words found in emails which occur more than or equal to 100 times in all emails.

### Next run processing_emails_to_find_occurance_of_words.py 
This will help to find the occurance of each word in the emails dataset and make frequency.csv file which stores the frequency of each important word present in wordlist.csv in every email.

### Finally run the svm_implementation.py 
This will help to study the predicted results of Support Vector Machine Algorithm on the dataset.
